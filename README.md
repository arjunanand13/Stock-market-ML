Predicting stock market using Stacked LSTM model.

In this project, the model gets recent dataset from trading view website using its API.
I have created a stack LSTM model using keras , and input the training and testing dataset in 75:25 ratio.
It calculates the RMSE of both trainig and testing dataset and henceforth plots a graph.

Language used : Python.
